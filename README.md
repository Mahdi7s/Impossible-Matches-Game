It's a physics-based game in which winning each stage is done by throwing matchsticks and setting them on fire by impact or the body of a matchbox and lighting bombs and destructions.
This game was developed by me about 10 years ago using GML and Game Maker, you can use it as a reference.
Also you can download the windows version [Here](https://github.com/Mahdi7s/Impossible-Matches-Game/raw/main/build/Matchwoods-Default-1.0.0.0.exe).
